# Minimit Update

**Simple plugin to have a fullscreen browser and javascript detection**

Just put the php settings and the php include as shown in the source code, you can set the language and the browser's versions you want to check.

It has a fixed design where you can change the logo and the colors from the settings. The warning text is translated to English, Spagnish, German, French and Italian.
